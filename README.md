# Hey there, digital wanderer! 👋

## I'm Muhammad Wasif Ali Wasif - The Code Whisperer, Biome Magician, and the not-so-humble bragging rights owner at Quest.

Currently residing in the vibrant heart of Rawalpindi, Punjab, Pakistan, I'm a Software Engineer by trade at Quest. Picture this: a wizard in the realm of video games, conjuring up ecosystems with a mere flick of a function. That's me, delving into the mysteries of procedural generation of biomes in video games. Hogwarts, who?

### 📚 Education? Oh, I've had some.
Navigated the treacherous waters of FAST(NUCES) University, emerging victorious in 2024 with skills sharper than a compiler's error message. And yes, I made it onto the Dean's List so many times they nearly renamed it after me.

### 🎮 Experience? Let's just say I've been around the block.
- **Software Engineer @ Quest**: I engineer software. It's kind of in the title.
- **Game Developer @ USquare**: Wizard responsibile for crafting games in my cauldron
- **Creative Lead Game Development & various impressive sounding titles @ FAST Gaming Club**: I've led, I've developed, I've gamed. In that order.
- **Teacher Assistant in subjects you wish you understood**: HCI, DB, Data Structures... You name it, I've taught it.

### 🛠 Skills? I speak fluent computer.
- **Unity**: Bringing game characters to life since... well, not too long ago, but who's counting?
- **Python Automation**: Master of scripts and spells, from Selenium web drivers weaving through the web without a browser, to Pandas conjuring data transformations faster than you can blink. Automation? Just another day's wizardry.
- **MERN Stack**: Not a stack of pancakes, but almost as delicious for your web projects.
- **GitHub**: Yes, I git it. Do you?
- **[Insert every programming language ever]**: If it's been coded, I've probably dabbled in it.

### 🏆 Accolades? A modest collection.
Dean's List of Honors - So often it might as well be my permanent address.

### 📜 Certifications? A scroll's worth.
- **AWS Certified**: I cloud better than most. Yes, that's now a verb.

### 🤷‍♂️ Open to work? Hiring?
Let's not get too hasty. I'm currently crafting digital worlds and bending code to my will. But hey, keep an eye out. You never know when I might grace another organization with my presence.

### 📍 Where am I?
Physically, Rawalpindi. Digitally, everywhere.

### 📬 Want to know more? Too bad.
Just kidding. If you're not scared off my devastating wit, feel free to connect. I might even share the secret to my success. Hint: it involves a lot of caffeine and even more semicolons.
